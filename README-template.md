## Overview

### The challenge

- Need to improve the speed 
- cant understand how to achieve background

## My process
Create the layout first check for responsiveness and than put content

### What I learned
If row is going out side the div put margin to auto
```css
#card .row{
    border-top: 2px solid lightgray;
    margin: auto;
}
```
Center horizonatally absolute div
```css
#card .personCard .lower img{
    position: absolute;
    left: 0; 
    right: 0; 
    margin-left: auto; 
    margin-right: auto; 
}
```
